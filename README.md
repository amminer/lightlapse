# lightlapse
A Python program built around the raspberry pi to aid in managing environmental conditions for plants and other photosynthetic organisms.  Hoping to add a ton of features including:  Set-point &amp; scheduled temperature maintenance via GPIO with multiple zones multiple light zones -moisture &amp; pH measurement, automated watering and pH balancing via GPIO -configurable camera settings (exposure, warmth for different lighting, focus, etc) Bit of a passion project of a delinquent biologist, work is slow especially when one needs to order peripherals in these pandemic times. Stay safe.
