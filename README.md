# lightlapse
A Python program built around the raspberry pi
to aid in managing environmental conditions
for plants and other photosynthetic organisms.

Hoping to add many features including but not limited to:
- Set-point and scheduled temperature maintenance via GPIO with multiple zones multiple light zones.
- Moisture and pH measurement, automated watering and pH balancing via GPIO.
- Configurable camera settings (exposure, warmth for different lighting, focus, etc).

Passion project of a delinquent biologist, work is slow especially when one needs to order peripherals from China in these pandemic times. Stay safe.
